<h3>GIS Data</h3>

<p>
  Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Data denotes the representation of geographic features and information.  There are two main categories of GIS data formats, raster data and vector data.  Raster data can be though of as an image, where each pixel corresponds to a rectangular region of the map.
  GeoTIFF is such a format where RGB values are stored for each region, and georeferencing metadata is embedded in the file.
  Vector fomats store only points where there is relevant data, so it is more flexible.
  Vector data stores shapes as a set of vector locations (X,Y coordinates) and other attributes, such as a measure or Z coordinate.
  The advantage of vector data over rasterized data is that vector data only stores a point when there is a measurement, or point of interest corresponding to it.
  Rasterized images require that you have a value for every rectangle in your grid, which can mean that you will store unnecessary information is there is no data in some of those grid regions.
  Vector data is an example of a sparse data format, where it only stores data when it has to, and doesn't force the data into a grid pattern which may cause approximation errors (in a process called rasterization).
</p>

<p>
  A common format is the shapefile, which is the standard format for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
  The basic atomic unit of the shapefile is the Point, which contains just X and Y coordinates.
  The PointZ and PointM type contain X,Y coordinates and an additional measure or altitude value.
  Polygons and Polylines are a collection of Points, which correspond to the vertices of the polylines (the points at which the polyline change direction).
  The shapefile (extension shp) is accompanied by an index file (extension shx) and a dBASE file (extension dbf).
  Other file types are often included but are not required.

<h3>Basemap</h3>

<p>
You can install basemap with conda or using <a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/">pip and wheels</a>.
</p>
<h4>Checkpoint: Go through the <a href="code/aquifer_basemap.ipynb">jupyter notebook</a>.</h4>

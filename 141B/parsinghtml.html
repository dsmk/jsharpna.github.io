<h3>HTML</h3>

<p>
  We have already seen basic syntax for hypertext markup language (HTML), and really that is all that you need.  Just know that there are tags, such as <code>div, a, body, span</code> that will wrap more markup.  This happens by the use of openning and closing tags <code>&lt;div class='example'&gt;text in between&lt;&#47;div&gt;</code> where the closing tag matches the openning tag, except there is an additional &#47;.  The tag has a name, div, and some attributes, such as class='example'.  When request an html file from a url, it is returned as a string, and you will need to process the html.  BeautifulSoup and lxml can help with that by parsing it based on the tags.  If a tag is nested inside of another tag then we say that that tag is a child of the other.  This means that the tags will naturally have a tree structure.  This is because tree structures require relationships between objects to be a parent-child type, so that each element branches to its children.  For example, the HTML, <code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;text 1&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;text 1&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</code> has a div tag with children p and span.  Each of these have accompanying text.  BeautifulSoup will help you navigate this tree structure.

<p>The following videos are based on the <a href="code/HTML parser.ipynb">jupyter notebook</a>.  In it we will web-scrape the data.gov cite for climate change related datasets.  While this only goes through HTML, XML has the same structure, so parsing it will be the same.</p>
